Solve a linear Stokes problem in 2D, an example of a saddle-point system.
Three problem cases:
  1. Lid-driven cavity with quadratic velocity on lid and Dirichlet conditions
     on all sides and a null space of constant pressures.  The default problem.
  2. -analytical:  Analytical exact solution from Logg et al (2012).
  3. -nobase:  Same as 1. but with stress-free condition on bottom so the null
     space is trivial.
Uses mixed FE method, either Taylor-Hood family (P^k x P^l, or Q^k x Q^l with
-quad) or CD with discontinuous pressure; default is P^2 x P^1.  Uses either
uniform mesh or reads a mesh in Gmsh format.  See source code for Schur+GMG
PC packages.  The prefix for PETSC solver options is 's_'.  Use -help for
PETSc options and -stokeshelp for options to stokes.py.

options:
  -analytical   Stokes problem with exact solution
  -dp           use discontinuous-Galerkin finite elements for pressure
  -lidscale X   scale for lid velocity (rightward positive; default=1.0)
  -mesh INNAME  input file for mesh in Gmsh format (.msh)
  -mx MX        number of grid points in x-direction (uniform case)
  -my MY        number of grid points in y-direction (uniform case)
  -mu MU        constant dynamic viscosity (default=1.0)
  -nobase       Stokes problem with stress-free boundary condition on base
  -o OUTNAME    output file name for Paraview format (.pvd)
  -pdegree L    polynomial degree for pressure (default=1)
  -quad         use quadrilateral finite elements
  -refine R     number of refinement levels (e.g. for GMG)
  -schurgmg X   Schur+GMG PC solver package: diag|lower|full
  -schurpre X   how Schur block is preconditioned: selfp|mass
  -showinfo     print function space sizes and solution norms
  -stokeshelp   print help for stokes.py options and exit
  -udegree K    polynomial degree for velocity (default=2)
  -vectorlap    use vector laplacian residual formula
