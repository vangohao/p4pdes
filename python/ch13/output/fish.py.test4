usage: fish.py [-fishhelp] [-mx MX] [-my MY] [-o NAME] [-k K] [-quad]
               [-refine X]

Use Firedrake's nonlinear solver for the Poisson problem
  -Laplace(u) = f        in the unit square
            u = g        on the boundary
Compare c/ch6/fish.c.  The prefix for PETSC solver options is 's_'.
Use -help for PETSc options and -fishhelp for options to fish.py.

options:
  -fishhelp  print help for fish.py options and exit
  -mx MX     number of grid points in x-direction
  -my MY     number of grid points in y-direction
  -o NAME    output file name ending with .pvd
  -k K       polynomial degree for elements
  -quad      use quadrilateral finite elements
  -refine X  number of refinement levels (e.g. for GMG)
